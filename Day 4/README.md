<h2>--- Day 4: Camp Cleanup ---</h2>
<p>Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique <em>ID number</em>, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.</p>
<p>However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments <em>overlap</em>. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a <em>big list of the section assignments for each pair</em> (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:</p>
<pre><code>2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8
</code></pre>
<p>For the first few pairs, this list means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections <code>2-4</code> (sections <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code>), while the second Elf was assigned sections <code>6-8</code> (sections <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>8</code>).</li>
<li>The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.</li>
<li>The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, and <code>7</code>, while the other also got <code>7</code>, plus <code>8</code> and <code>9</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:</p>
<pre><code>.234.....  2-4
.....678.  6-8

.23...... 2-3
...45.... 4-5

....567.. 5-7
......789 7-9

.2345678. 2-8
..34567.. 3-7

.....6... 6-6
...456... 4-6

.23456... 2-6
...45678. 4-8
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments <em>fully contains</em> the other. For example, <code>2-8</code> fully contains <code>3-7</code>, and <code>6-6</code> is fully contained by <code>4-6</code>. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are <code><em>2</em></code> such pairs.</p>
<p><em>In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?</em></p>

<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>As you watch the crane operator expertly rearrange the crates, you notice the process isn't following your prediction.</p>
<p>Some mud was covering the writing on the side of the crane, and you quickly wipe it away. The crane isn't a CrateMover 9000 - it's a <em><span title="It's way better than the old CrateMover 1006.">CrateMover 9001</span></em>.</p>
<p>The CrateMover 9001 is notable for many new and exciting features: air conditioning, leather seats, an extra cup holder, and <em>the ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once</em>.</p>
<p>Again considering the example above, the crates begin in the same configuration:</p>
<pre><code>    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 
</code></pre>
<p>Moving a single crate from stack 2 to stack 1 behaves the same as before:</p>
<pre><code>[D]        
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 
</code></pre>
<p>However, the action of moving three crates from stack 1 to stack 3 means that those three moved crates <em>stay in the same order</em>, resulting in this new configuration:</p>
<pre><code>        [D]
        [N]
    [C] [Z]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3
</code></pre>
<p>Next, as both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1, they <em>retain their order</em> as well:</p>
<pre><code>        [D]
        [N]
[C]     [Z]
[M]     [P]
 1   2   3
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, a single crate is still moved from stack 1 to stack 2, but now it's crate <code>C</code> that gets moved:</p>
<pre><code>        [<em>D</em>]
        [N]
        [Z]
[<em>M</em>] [<em>C</em>] [P]
 1   2   3
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the CrateMover 9001 has put the crates in a totally different order: <code><em>MCD</em></code>.</p>
<p>Before the rearrangement process finishes, update your simulation so that the Elves know where they should stand to be ready to unload the final supplies. <em>After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?</em></p>
